# CharacterCreatorXR - agent rules

WebXR host for the CharacterCreator character system. Sister repos:
CharacterCreator (the character system, roadmap in its `docs/ROADMAP.md`) and
CharacterCreatorBaseline (vanilla MPFB baseline + the live compare site).

Placeholders used in all committed files: `<scratch>` = the local scratch/work
directory, `<blender>` = the Blender executable, `<tools>` = local tool installs.
Never commit real machine paths, host names, IPs, users or key paths.

## Git: one worktree per agent

- Never work in, `git checkout`/`git switch` in, or commit from the shared main
  working directory. Each agent gets its own worktree under `<scratch>`:
  `git worktree add <scratch>/wt/<name> -b <branch> master`
  and removes it (`git worktree remove`) when done.
- Never commit to `master`. Work on a named branch (`phase<N>/<milestone>`,
  `spike/<name>`).
- Never `git add -A` / `git add .`; stage exact paths.
- Never change or delete a ref someone else made without a backup tag on its
  SHA first (`backup/<context>/<name>-<sha7>`). Never `git reset --hard` or
  `git clean` in a main working directory. Never delete untracked files before
  `git diff --no-index` against the committed version shows they are identical.
- Do not touch other agents' worktrees.

## Deploy

- Nothing in this repo deploys to `webxr/charactercreator/`. That path is
  written ONLY by CharacterCreatorBaseline's `deploy.ps1`.
- Agents never deploy anywhere. A deploy or server change happens only after
  the owner says yes to that specific action.

## Nothing public without the owner's yes

No push, fork, issue, comment, PR, release, tag push or deploy without the
owner's explicit yes for that action. Agents make drafts, local branches and
local tags only.

## Images

Agents produce images/screenshots (e.g. `npm run shots`) and measure
numerically; agents running on Opus do not view them. Visual review is done by
Luna (and the owner). An agent's acceptance criterion is always numeric; visual
review is a separate gate.

## Commands

- `npm test` (node:test), `npm run serve`, `npm run sync`, `npm run shots`.
- Long runs (> ~2 min) go in the background with a log under `<scratch>`.
